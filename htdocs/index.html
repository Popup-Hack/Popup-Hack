            <h1>Hacking for busy people.</h1>
            <p><strong style="color: #007399">Popup Hack</strong> is a community of hackers who like to make stuff for fun. We gather in informal spaces <i>(usually bars)</i> to hack, learn and of course have a few pints. No hefty commitment. No all-nighters.</p>
            <br /><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/popuphack.co.uk/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJJRGMwVzVyOWZRUWdyMlFXUE9Ld0E6MQ" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Sounds great, sign me up &raquo;</a></p>

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Hacker weekends are fantastic, but they don't happen very often and when they do, a whole weekend is a lot of time to give
                    up all at once.</p>
                    <p>Popup Hack is like a bite-size hacker day. A few hours each month to hack on fun projects with friends.
                </p>

                <h2>Do I have to join a project?</h2>
                <p>No. Have your own thing you want to work on, but would like to partake of our company? That's fine! 
                As long as you're hacking on something. There'll be plenty of chat and beer, but hacking should be the primary focus.</p>
