# Hacking for busy people.


*Popup Hack* is a community of hackers who like to make stuff for fun. We gather in informal spaces (usually bars) to hack, learn and of course have a few pints. No hefty commitment. No all-nighters.

Hacker weekends are fantastic, but they don't happen very often and when they do, a whole weekend is a lot of time to give up all at once.

Popup Hack is like a bite-size hacker day. A few hours each month to hack on fun projects with friends.
